As part of the quality assurance process, the development team needs to test the integration with a series of sample inputs\u2014even ones that may not represent coherent text\u2014to ensure that the system routes and processes the data correctly.\nBefore rolling out the live system, the team creates a test harness using Python. The harness employs the httpx library to send POST requests to OpenAI's API. For this proof-of-concept, the team uses the dummy model gpt-4o-mini along with a dummy API key in the Authorization header to simulate real API calls.\nOne of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text:\ngH  Iee4XZdygi HyZ7p8  vH6F8i yxKpn he Dou IH41kL\nWrite a Python program that uses httpx to send a POST request to OpenAI's API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically:\nMake sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.\nUse gpt-4o-mini as the model.\nThe first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text.

Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.\nNote: This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one.

    "description": "\n    InfoCore Solutions is a technology consulting firm that maintains an extensive internal knowledge base of technical documents, project reports, and case studies. Employees frequently search through these documents to answer client questions quickly or gain insights for ongoing projects. However, due to the sheer volume of documentation, traditional keyword-based search often returns too many irrelevant results.\nTo address this issue, InfoCore's data science team decides to integrate a semantic search feature into their internal portal. This feature uses text embeddings to capture the contextual meaning of both the documents and the user's query. The documents are pre-embedded, and when an employee submits a search query, the system computes the similarity between the query's embedding and those of the documents. The API then returns a ranked list of document identifiers based on similarity.\nImagine you are an engineer on the InfoCore team. Your task is to build a FastAPI POST endpoint that accepts an array of docs and query string via a JSON body. The endpoint is structured as follows:\nPOST /similarity\n{\n  \"docs\": [\"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\", \"Contents of document 3\", ...],\n  \"query\": \"Your query string\"\n}\nService Flow:\nRequest Payload: The client sends a POST request with a JSON body containing:\ndocs: An array of document texts from the internal knowledge base.\nquery: A string representing the user's search query.\nEmbedding Generation: For each document in the docs array and for the query string, the API computes a text embedding using text-embedding-3-small.\nSimilarity Computation: The API then calculates the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each document embedding. This allows the service to determine which documents best match the intent of the query.\nResponse Structure: After ranking the documents by their similarity scores, the API returns the identifiers (or positions) of the three most similar documents. The JSON response might look like this:\n{\n  \"matches\": [\"Contents of document 3\", \"Contents of document 1\", \"Contents of document 2\"]\n}\nHere, \"Contents of document 3\" is considered the closest match, followed by \"Contents of document 1\", then \"Contents of document 2\".\nMake sure you enable CORS to allow OPTIONS and POST methods, perhaps allowing all origins and headers.\nWhat is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/similarity\nWe'll check by sending a POST request to this URL with a JSON body containing random docs and query.\n    "

In the backend, a FastAPI app routes each request by matching the query to one of a set of pre-defined functions. The response that the API returns is used by OpenAI to call the right function with the necessary arguments.\nPre-Defined Functions:\nFor this exercise, assume the following functions have been defined:\nget_ticket_status(ticket_id: int)\nschedule_meeting(date: str, time: str, meeting_room: str)\nget_expense_balance(employee_id: int)\ncalculate_performance_bonus(employee_id: int, current_year: int)\nreport_office_issue(issue_code: int, department: str)\nEach function has a specific signature, and the student\u2019s FastAPI app should map specific queries to these functions.\nExample Questions (Templatized with a Random Number):\nTicket Status:\nQuery: \"What is the status of ticket 83742?\"\n\u2192 Should map to get_ticket_status(ticket_id=83742)\nMeeting Scheduling:\nQuery: \"Schedule a meeting on 2025-02-15 at 14:00 in Room A.\"\n\u2192 Should map to schedule_meeting(date=\"2025-02-15\", time=\"14:00\", meeting_room=\"Room A\")\nExpense Reimbursement:\nQuery: \"Show my expense balance for employee 10056.\"\n\u2192 Should map to get_expense_balance(employee_id=10056)\nPerformance Bonus Calculation:\nQuery: \"Calculate performance bonus for employee 10056 for 2025.\"\n\u2192 Should map to calculate_performance_bonus(employee_id=10056, current_year=2025)\nOffice Issue Reporting:\nQuery: \"Report office issue 45321 for the Facilities department.\"\n\u2192 Should map to report_office_issue(issue_code=45321, department=\"Facilities\")\nTask Overview:\nDevelop a FastAPI application that:\nExposes a GET endpoint /execute?q=... where the query parameter q contains one of the pre-templatized questions.\nAnalyzes the q parameter to identify which function should be called.\nExtracts the parameters from the question text.\nReturns a response in the following JSON format:\n{ \"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": \"{ ...JSON encoded parameters... }\" }\nFor example, the query \"What is the status of ticket 83742?\" should return:\n{\n  \"name\": \"get_ticket_status\",\n  \"arguments\": \"{\"ticket_id\": 83742}\"\n}\nMake sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.\nWhat is the API URL endpoint for your implementation? It might look like: http://127.0.0.1:8000/execute\nWe'll check by sending a GET request to this URL with ?q=... containing a task. We'll verify that it matches the expected response.

Their clients rely on accurate, detailed sales reports to make strategic decisions regarding product placement, inventory management, and marketing campaigns. However, the quality of these insights depends on the reliability of the underlying sales data.\n\n    One major challenge GlobalRetail faces is the inconsistent recording of city names in sales data. Due to human error and regional differences, city names can be mis-spelt (e.g., \"Tokio\" instead of \"Tokyo\"). This inconsistency complicates the process of aggregating sales data by city, which is crucial for identifying regional trends and opportunities.\n\n    GlobalRetail Insights recently received a dataset named  from one of its large retail clients. The dataset consists of 2,500 sales entries, each containing the following fields:\n\n    city: The city where the sale was made. Note that city names may be mis-spelt phonetically (e.g., \"Tokio\" instead of \"Tokyo\").\n    product: The product sold. This field is consistently spelled.\n    sales: The number of units sold.\n    The client's goal is to evaluate the performance of a specific product across various regions. However, due to the mis-spelled city names, directly aggregating sales by city would lead to fragmented and misleading insights.\n\n    Your Task\n    As a data analyst at GlobalRetail Insights, you are tasked with extracting meaningful insights from this dataset. Specifically, you need to:\n\n    Group Mis-spelt City Names: Use phonetic clustering algorithms to group together entries that refer to the same city despite variations in spelling. For instance, cluster \"Tokyo\" and \"Tokio\" as one.\n    Filter Sales Entries: Select all entries where:\n    The product sold is Mouse.\n    The number of units sold is at least 164.\n    Aggregate Sales by City: After clustering city names, group the filtered sales entries by city and calculate the total units sold for each city.\n    By performing this analysis, GlobalRetail Insights will be able to:\n\n    Improve Data Accuracy: Correct mis-spellings and inconsistencies in the dataset, leading to more reliable insights.\n    Target Marketing Efforts: Identify high-performing regions for the specific product, enabling targeted promotional strategies.\n    Optimize Inventory Management: Ensure that inventory allocations reflect the true demand in each region, reducing wastage and stockouts.\n    Drive Strategic Decision-Making: Provide actionable intelligence to clients that supports strategic planning and competitive advantage in the market.\n    How many units of Mouse were sold in Jakarta on transactions with at least 164 units?"

    "description": "Case Study: Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics\n    ReceiptRevive Analytics is a data recovery and business intelligence firm specializing in processing legacy sales data from paper receipts. Many of the client companies have archives of receipts from past years, which have been digitized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques. However, due to the condition of some receipts (e.g., torn, faded, or partially damaged), the OCR process sometimes produces incomplete JSON data. These imperfections can lead to truncated fields or missing values, which complicates the process of data aggregation and analysis.\n\n    One of ReceiptRevive\u2019s major clients, RetailFlow Inc., operates numerous brick-and-mortar stores and has an extensive archive of old receipts. RetailFlow Inc. needs to recover total sales information from a subset of these digitized receipts to analyze historical sales performance. The provided JSON data contains 100 rows, with each row representing a sales entry. Each entry is expected to include four keys:\n\n    city: The city where the sale was made.\n    product: The product that was sold.\n    sales: The number of units sold (or sales revenue).\n    id: A unique identifier for the receipt.\n    Due to damage to some receipts during the digitization process, the JSON entries are truncated at the end, and the id field is missing. Despite this, RetailFlow Inc. is primarily interested in the aggregate sales value.\n\n    Your Task\n    As a data recovery analyst at ReceiptRevive Analytics, your task is to develop a program that will:\n\n    Parse the Sales Data:\n    Read the provided JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data. Despite the truncated data (specifically the missing id), you must accurately extract the sales figures from each row.\n    Data Validation and Cleanup:\n    Ensure that the data is properly handled even if some fields are incomplete. Since the id is missing for some entries, your focus will be solely on the sales values.\n    Calculate Total Sales:\n    Sum the sales values across all 100 rows to provide a single aggregate figure that represents the total sales recorded.\n    By successfully recovering and aggregating the sales data, ReceiptRevive Analytics will enable RetailFlow Inc. to:\n\n    Reconstruct Historical Sales Data: Gain insights into past sales performance even when original receipts are damaged.\n    Inform Business Decisions: Use the recovered data to understand sales trends, adjust inventory, and plan future promotions.\n    Enhance Data Recovery Processes: Improve methods for handling imperfect OCR data, reducing future data loss and increasing data accuracy.\n    Build Client Trust: Demonstrate the ability to extract valuable insights from challenging datasets, thereby reinforcing client confidence in ReceiptRevive's services.\n    Download the data from\n\n    What is the total sales value?"

As part of their service offerings, DataSure collects extensive logs from thousands of servers and applications worldwide. These logs, stored in JSON format, are rich with information about system performance, error events, and user interactions. However, the logs are complex and deeply nested, which can make it challenging to quickly identify recurring issues or anomalous behavior.\n\n    Recently, DataSure's operations team observed an increase in system alerts and minor anomalies reported by their monitoring tools. To diagnose these issues more effectively, the team needs to perform a detailed analysis of the log files. One critical step is to count how often a specific key (e.g., \"errorCode\", \"criticalFlag\", or any other operational parameter represented by K) appears in the log entries.\n\n    Key considerations include:\n\n    Complex Structure: The log files are large and nested, with multiple levels of objects and arrays. The target key may appear at various depths.\n    Key vs. Value: The key may also appear as a value within the logs, but only occurrences where it is a key should be counted.\n    Operational Impact: Identifying the frequency of this key can help pinpoint common issues, guide system improvements, and inform maintenance strategies.\n    Your Task\n    As a data analyst at DataSure Technologies, you have been tasked with developing a script that processes a large JSON log file and counts the number of times a specific key, represented by the placeholder K, appears in the JSON structure.

One of their recurring challenges involves reconstructing damaged or deliberately scrambled images to reveal hidden details critical to solving cases.\n\n    In a recent investigation, law enforcement received an anonymous tip involving a scrambled image that appeared to contain sensitive information. The image had been deliberately cut into 25 (5x5) pieces and rearranged to obfuscate its content. Recovering the original image was essential for uncovering evidence related to the case.\n\n    PixelGuard's forensic team extracted the scrambled pieces and obtained a mapping file that specifies the transformation from the original (row, col) positions to the new positions. However, the team now needs to reassemble the image according to this mapping to restore its original appearance.\n\n    Your Task\n    As a digital forensics analyst at PixelGuard Solutions, your task is to reconstruct the original image from its scrambled pieces. You are provided with:\n\n    The 25 individual image pieces (put together as a single image).\n    A mapping file detailing the original (row, col) position for each piece and its current (row, col) location.\n    Your reconstructed image will be critical evidence in the investigation. Once assembled, the image must be uploaded to the secure case management system for further analysis by the investigative team.\n\n    Understand the Mapping: Review the provided mapping file that shows how each piece's original coordinates (row, col) relate to its current scrambled position.\n    Reassemble the Image: Using the mapping, reassemble the 5x5 grid of image pieces to reconstruct the original image.
